Files for my portable installation used in field repairs

This repository contains scripts and Files used for my portable installation of Manjaro-Linux on an external SSD.
It's is planned as a single solution containing all tools which might be neccesary during work in the field.
The kit works by using iso files inside a virtual machine which connects to the physical drives in order to install or repair operating systems,
carry out data rescue and secure deletion as well as perform network analysis.

Feel free to use and modify any of the scripts and files if they help you :)
